Using my problem-solving mindset, I have successfully managed and delivered projects, including CRM systems, functional web apps, and decentralized finance applications like NFT and Token marketplaces, ICOs sales, Vesting, Staking, ERC20/721 assets, Uniswap, and handling real transactions and testing them with end-to-end functionality. Through fast-paced productivity, I have experience working as a Full Stack Developer in different types of firms where I have used the same DeFi tech stack for building production-grade software. These experiences make me suitable for this role which revolves around the same tech stack. Also, my previous work was in start-ups and fast-paced environments with full responsibility and independence. I've delivered POCs for tech stack upgrades and modules for a live product. My project management enabled me to lead teams of fellow developers across full project development journeys.</p>",

I developed four key services: the Auth-Service for user authentication and authorization, the Customer-Service for managing customer data, the Cart-Service for handling cart information and the Order-Service for handling orders of the customers. Utilizing Spring Boot, I ensured each service operated independently with its own database, allowing for scalability and maintainability.

My dedication resulted in generating over 4.4 million impressions and more than 800k views on YouTube, marking a significant milestone in my creative evolution.</p><p>As my skills sharpened, I transitioned into professional freelancing, working with a diverse range of clients from the US and Nepal. I now possess a strong command of 3D animations, YouTube video editing, Instagram Reels editing, and product video animation. Whether it’s creating dynamic content for social media or crafting intricate animations, I offer a full suite of video editing services tailored to meet the unique needs of each client.

I worked for several small projects also in my career which were mainly ecommerce. Although they do not have a great customer base but they've taught me a better way of understanding and moving forward. In my career Ive developed few AI/ ML applications which were a part of several business internally and externally. One such externally available ML models with UI are used in BroChill application which has almost 45M downloads.

With already 30+ clients, each with user base of 1.5k the problem was data gathering from all users. They could not use google forms etc. because those did not suite our use case. Workflows is a JSON based versioned form builder. It is fast, secure and allows for a lot more features than basic form builders in market. The feature took around 2-3 months with rigorous brainstorming and ideation. Node.js ( Express.js ) built the robust backend support with Typescript. Frontend was made using React. Payment system was integrated which used PayMongo. Several other tools - VCS using git, hosting on AWS EC2 , Database on MongoDB etc. As a result, they had their own in-house form builder fit for our use case and versatile enough to be used by anyone. They gained 7+ clients after first release of Workflows. They also had potential clients who wanted to try workflows for Event management. This led into ideation of a new revenue channel by tapping into Philippines event market.<br></p><h2>Filpass - Template Designer</h2><p>Digitizing hard copy of certificates using the manual process takes weeks. They needed an interactive design tool to create digital certificates within browsers.</p><p>I was part of the 2 member team that built Template Designer (TD) which is a canvas design tool made using React. It uses role-based access management with 2 factor authentication which was implemented in BE using Node / TS.</p><p>It works collaboratively with FilPass system and Workflows creating a one stop solution for digital tamperproof certificates.</p><p></p><h2>FPAS - Features updates and maintenance</h2><p>FPAS is a member management system designed for a Singapore based client. It handles 6k+ students, their course curriculum and certificate payments.</p><p>I was the lead on this project with a team of 2 developers and 1 UI/UX.</p><p>The system needed periodic maintenance with Node and Angular upgrades. Also, I designed and implemented multiple client feature requests with the team as per their business requirements. Time to time hotfixes and handling of user issues.</p>",

I’ve been gaining practical experience in web development and programming, and I’m passionate about creating innovative solutions.</p><p>I’ve been working part-time at Surfersway Company since November 2022, where I’ve contributed to various projects. In terms of web development, I’ve completed three projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Agni Fashion</strong>: A shopping website where handmade jewelry can be sold directly to customers via WhatsApp.</p></li><li><p><strong>Email Templates</strong>: I created a series of static email templates using HTML and CSS.</p></li><li><p><strong>Human Detection Project</strong>: I’m working on a dynamic Python project that fetches video from a CCTV camera every 15 minutes, takes snapshots every 5 seconds, and allows users to mark a specific location on one of the snapshots. If a person is detected in that marked location, the system saves the date, time, camera name, number of people detected, and stores all this data in a database.</p></li></ul><p>I’m always eager to learn and grow, and I look forward to future opportunities to apply my skills.</p>",
